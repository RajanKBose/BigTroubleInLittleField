    <string name="tab_about">The campus here at The University of Texas at Austin has so much history behind it, that not many people know about. Everyday, students mindlessly walk to class, without taking notice of all the small details. These details are what makes our campus unique, and we want to ensure that they get the attention they deserve.</string>
    <string name="tab_instructions">Upon starting the game, you will be given your first clue. Use your map to view all possible locations to help you. Once you know the location of the clue, go to that location. If you are at the correct location, you will alerted that you have made it, and will be able to respond to the message with your answer. Game play will continue until you have solved all of the puzzles.</string>
